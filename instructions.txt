1. Open the folder/directory where uno_custom.zip is (don't actually open uno_custom.zip though).

2. Right-click (or Control + Click) inside the folder.

3. Select "New Terminal at Folder". The terminal should open.

4. Copy and paste each line one at a time into the terminal, and press enter to run:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"  # Ensure Homebrew is active

brew install python

unzip uno_custom.zip -d uno_custom

cd uno_project

python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip  # Ensure pip is available

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

pip3 install pyinstaller

pyinstaller --windowed --name="UnoGame" --add-data="cards:cards" --add-data="sounds:sounds" uno_gui.py

3. Locate the app in the folder titled "dist".

4. Open it to play.

5. You can move the app to your desired location now. You can delete all the other files if you want.
